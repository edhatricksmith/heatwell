        <p>That probably means that either the link you just used is broken or you've entered the page URL incorrectly.</p>
        <p>If it's the latter, check you've entered the URL correctly in the address bar and then refresh the page.</p>
        <p>If it's the former then probably we need to sort it out :P I'd love <a class="text-link" href="mailto:heating@ihug.co.nz">an email</a> with the details of the problem so I can fix it.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, why don't you head back to our <a class="text-link" href="http://heatwell.co.nz/">Home page</a> and start afresh</p>
