        <h3>Radiant Heating – How It Works</h3>
        <p>Radiant heat is based on the same method of the sun heating the earth. Radiant heat energy travels similar to radio waves. When this energy hits a solid object it absorbs the energy and heats that object. This provides a natural form of heat that will not cause a stuffy atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Heating all the objects in your room will limit your body's tendency to give up it's heat. Once the solid objects in the room are warm the air is then heated and the room will no longer be cold.</p>
